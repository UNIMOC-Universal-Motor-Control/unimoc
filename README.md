# UNIMOC: Universal Motor Control Library

---

The **UNIMOC Library** (**UNI**versal **MO**tor **C**ontrol) provides platform-independent functions and algorithms for controlling synchronous and asynchronous motors. It primarily focuses on **Field-Oriented Control (FOC)** for multi-phase motors.

## Features

* **Platform-Independent:** Designed to work across various hardware platforms.
* **Synchronous Motor Control:** Currently supports **Brushless DC (BLDC)** motors.
* **Field-Oriented Control (FOC):** Implements advanced FOC algorithms for precise motor control.
* **Modular Design:** Built with a modular architecture for easy integration and extension.

## Planned Features

* **Asynchronous Motor Support:** Future updates will include algorithms for controlling asynchronous motors.
* **Synchronous Reluctance Motors:** While not directly supported yet, you can control synchronous reluctance motors with some adaptation of the existing synchronous motor code.

## Out of Scope

* **Stepper FOC:** Field-Oriented Control for stepper motors isn't currently planned.
