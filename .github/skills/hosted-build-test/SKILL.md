# Hosted Build And Test

Use this skill for the portable library and hosted GoogleTest targets. The
workflow is host-independent in intent and works on Windows and Linux; only
the shell syntax and tool installation differ.

## Required tools

The following commands must be available on `PATH`:

- CMake 4.x
- Ninja
- A C++23 host compiler
- GoogleTest dependencies resolved by the CMake project

For static analysis, also require `clang++` and `clang-tidy`. For formatting,
require `clang-format`. On Windows, install LLVM and expose these commands to
the current VS Code terminal. On Linux, use the distribution packages or the
toolchain already used by CI.

Check the environment before configuring:

```text
cmake --version
ninja --version
clang-tidy --version
clang-format --version
```

The compiler and analysis tools are only required for the checks being run.

## Standard hosted workflow

Run the repository workflow preset from the project root:

```text
cmake --workflow --preset "Hosted configure, build and test"
```

This configures the `Hosted build with tests` preset, builds it, and runs the
`Hosted Test` preset with failure output.

## Hosted workflow with clang-tidy

Run the static-analysis workflow when changing C++ diagnostics, public
headers, control algorithms, observers, system types, or unit wrappers:

```text
cmake --workflow --preset "Hosted configure, build and test + clang tidy"
```

The preset uses `clang++` and enables the repository's clang-tidy integration.
If configuration fails because `clang++` or `clang-tidy` is not found, fix the
host environment before changing CMake settings.

## Focused validation

For a short feedback loop, configure and build the hosted target once, then
filter the tests with a focused regular expression:

```text
cmake --preset "Hosted build with tests"
cmake --build --preset "Hosted build with tests"
ctest --preset "Hosted Test" -R "<test-regex>" --output-on-failure
```

Use the full `Hosted Test` preset when the change affects shared behavior or
when no focused test covers the changed path.

## clang-format

Format only changed C++ files. First check formatting without modifying files:

```text
clang-format --dry-run --Werror <changed-cpp-files>
```

To apply formatting after the user agrees or the task requires it:

```text
clang-format -i <changed-cpp-files>
```

On PowerShell, obtain changed files with:

```powershell
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR | Where-Object { $_ -match '\.(c|cc|cpp|h|hh|hpp)$' } | ForEach-Object { clang-format --dry-run --Werror -- $_ }
```

On Linux or another POSIX shell, use:

```sh
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR -- '*.c' '*.cc' '*.cpp' '*.h' '*.hh' '*.hpp' | xargs -r clang-format --dry-run --Werror
```

## Firmware boundary

This skill validates hosted code only. For firmware changes, also use the
appropriate `BatteryCaseController Debug` or `BatteryCaseController Release`
preset after confirming the ARM GCC and modm prerequisites in `README.md`.
Hosted tests do not prove hardware behavior, PWM safety, startup behavior, or
NVM persistence.

## Completion

Report the exact preset or focused test command used, whether formatting was
checked, whether clang-tidy ran, and any host-specific prerequisite that was
unavailable. Do not stage or commit changes automatically.
