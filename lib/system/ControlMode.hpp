/**
 * @brief Active outer control loop selection.
 *
 * The top-level control loop selects one of these modes at runtime.  The
 * inner current/torque loops are always active; only the outer setpoint
 * source changes.
 *
 * TORQUE
 *   The torque (q-axis current) setpoint is commanded directly.
 *   No speed or position outer loop is active.
 *   Cyphal: receives uavcan.si.unit.torque or a normalised torque request.
 *
 * SPEED
 *   A speed PI loop drives the torque setpoint.
 *   The speed setpoint is received via Cyphal.
 *
 * POSITION
 *   A position P loop feeds a speed PI loop which drives the torque setpoint.
 *   Requires PositionTracker to be homed (is_homed == true) before commands
 *   are tracked; the application should refuse position commands until homed.
 *   The position setpoint (PositionController::pos_ref_rad) is received via
 *   Cyphal; homing is triggered via a Cyphal service call.

/**
 * @brief Select control mode from UDRAL servo rotational dynamics setpoint fields.
 *
 * Implements the mode selection described in:
 * `reg/udral/service/actuator/servo/_.0.1.dsdl`
 * using:
 * `reg/udral/physics/dynamics/rotation/Planar.0.1.dsdl`.
 *
 * Rule:
 * 1) First finite kinematics field selects the controlled quantity:
 *    angular_position -> POSITION, angular_velocity -> SPEED.
 * 2) angular_acceleration is not currently supported by UNIMOC and is ignored.
 * 3) If no kinematics command is provided, finite torque selects TORQUE mode.
 * 4) If nothing actionable is finite, return std::nullopt (ignore setpoint).
