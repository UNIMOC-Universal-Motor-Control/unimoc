 * @brief Data shared between the current-control ISR and the slow-update task
 *        for one half of the double buffer.
 *
 * Each element corresponds to one of the @p NUM_SUB_STEPS consecutive PWM
 * half-periods that make up one slow-update cycle.
 *
 * Layout
 * ------
 *  - **sc**            Pre-computed sin/cos for the Park transform at each
 *                      sub-step.  Written by the slow-update task; read by
 *                      the ISR.
 *  - **i_ab_samples**  Clarke-transformed stator current measured by the ISR
 *                      at each sub-step.  Written by the ISR; read by the
 *                      slow-update task.
 *
 * Ownership protocol
 * ------------------
 * Only one side writes each array:
 *  - SlowUpdate writes `sc[0..3]` into the **inactive** buffer, then flips
 *    `DoubleBuffer::active`.
 *  - The ISR writes `i_ab_samples[sub_step]` into the **active** buffer.
 *
 * Because SlowUpdate fully prepares the inactive buffer before the atomic
 * flip, the ISR never observes a half-written `sc` set.

/**
 * @brief Ping-pong pair of SubStepBuffers with an atomic active-index.
 *
 * The ISR reads from `buf[active]` and writes current samples into it.
 * The slow-update task writes new sin/cos values into `buf[1 − active]`
 * and then atomically flips `active`.
 *
 * Memory-ordering
 * ---------------
 *  - The slow-update task uses `memory_order_release` on the flip so that all
 *    writes to the inactive buffer are visible to any thread that subsequently
 *    reads `active` with `memory_order_acquire`.
 *  - The ISR uses `memory_order_acquire` when reading `active` at the start
 *    of each sub-step.
 *
 * The ISR is not preempted by the slow-update task (it runs at a higher IRQ
 * priority), so there is no race on `i_ab_samples`: the ISR completes all
 * four writes within the same set of four consecutive half-periods; the
 * slow-update task only reads them after `samples_ready` is set (at the end
 * of sub-step 3), by which time the ISR has moved back to sub-step 0 and is
 * writing into the same buffer again — the slow-update task reads the
 * *previous* four samples.
